For the case when the number of threads equals 1, user+sys (how long the program runs on all CPU cores in total)
time and real time are very close to be equal.

But when the number of threads increases, user+sys time will be usually greater than the real time,
because the program takes less wall clock time by utilising more CPU cores at a time
(in other words, different threads of the same program run simultaneously).

Also, I want to mention that the user+sys time will noticeably increase without a noticeable decrease in the real time
when the number of threads exceeds the number of CPU cores (8 for my case).
