Results of the experiment looks almost the same as the ones from the third exercise.
However, in the final iteration (M=100) noticeably more user+sys time has passed,
which is most likely indicates that threads spend more time waiting mutex to
unlock due to the huge number of them compared to the number of CPU cores.
