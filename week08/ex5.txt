Virtual address points to the virtual memory, which is a virtual main memory of machine.
Programs work with virtual addresses, and they have range of virtual address space available for them.

Physical address refers to real memory (RAM) address,
so internally computer translates virtual addresses to physical ones and makes requests to
the required device (RAM or hard drive).
Mapping between physical and virtual address is dynamic and usually made using idea of pages.
