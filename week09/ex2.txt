The aging page replacement algorithm performs better (with higher hit/miss ratio) when the number of repeated references is high and the number of unique pages referenced is low.
For example, if we take a sequence of 50 references to random pages in range [1, 11]:
7 11 11 7 2 8 7 8 5 1 5 1 11 11 9 3 7 3 10 11 1 8 8 11 1 11 6 11 6 11 7 2 10 9 3 11 1 7 4 4 9 2 10 5 8 1 5 9 9 2
only 12 misses will occur with the 10 page frames.
