Deadlock recovery might be a better strategy when the chance of deadlock is low, because this strategy requires
additional resources (for example, to store checkpoints for rollback purpose) or potentially harmful actions
(for example, killing process or snatching resource from it).

Deadlock prevention might be a better strategy when resource can be used by more than one process
(for example, resource has its own job queue) or there is a high probability of deadlocks so preventing
mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption or circular wait worth it.

Deadlock avoidance might be a better strategy when it is possible to review each resource allocation so that the
allocation does not cause the deadlock.
